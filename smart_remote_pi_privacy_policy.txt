Privacy Policy for Smart Remote PI
Last updated: February 23, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Smart Remote PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles user information. 
By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. Data Collection & Usage
Smart Remote PI is a local utility tool designed to act as a remote control for LG webOS televisions.
- We do not collect, transmit, intercept, or store personal data, usage logs, or analytics on external servers.
- The app communicates directly with your television over your local home network.
- Any app preferences (such as "Dark Mode" or "Early User" status) and TV pairing keys are stored securely and locally on your device using an encrypted database.

2. Network Discovery & Remote Control
- To provide a seamless experience, the app scans your local network to discover available LG TVs. This is done entirely on your device.
- We do not track which network you are connected to, nor do we track or record your TV usage, viewing habits, or the apps you choose to launch.
- All remote control commands are sent directly from your phone to your TV. No data is routed through third-party servers.

3. Permissions
The app requests the minimal permissions necessary for its core functionality:
- Network State & Internet: Used strictly locally to verify that your device's WiFi is turned on and to communicate with your TV. No personal data is transmitted over the internet by our app.
- Change WiFi Multicast State: Required to scan your local network to find your LG TV during the pairing process.
- Vibrate: Used to provide tactile feedback (haptics) when you press buttons on the remote.

4. Third-Party Services
- This version of the app does not use third-party analytics, tracking, advertising, or profiling services.
- No personal data is shared with or sold to third parties.

5. Security
- We employ local encryption to protect the TV pairing keys and user flags stored on your device.

6. Children's Privacy
- Smart Remote PI does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
