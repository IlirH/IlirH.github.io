Privacy Policy for Volume Booster PI
Last updated: February 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Volume Booster PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles user information. 
By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. Data Collection & Usage
Volume Booster PI is a strictly local utility tool designed to safely amplify your device's audio output.
- We do not collect, transmit, intercept, or store personal data, audio recordings, usage logs, or analytics on external servers.
- The app operates entirely offline and does not request or require internet access to function.
- App preferences (such as theme settings, notification dialogue flags, and internal user status) are stored securely and locally on your device using an encrypted database.

2. Audio Modification
- To provide its core functionality, the app applies audio gain to your device's media output using standard Android audio effects.
- The app does not record, listen to, or process the actual content of the audio being played (such as your music, videos, or phone calls). It solely modifies the output volume limits.

3. Permissions
The app requests the minimal permissions necessary for its core functionality:
- Modify Audio Settings: Required to adjust and enhance the device's volume and audio output levels safely.
- Foreground Service (Media Playback): Required by the Android operating system to keep the audio amplifier engine running smoothly in the background while you use other apps.
- Post Notifications: Required to display an ongoing control panel in your notification drawer, allowing you to easily monitor the engine status and turn it off at any time.

4. Third-Party Services
- This version of the app does not use third-party analytics, network libraries, tracking, advertising, or profiling services.
- No personal data is shared with or sold to third parties.

5. Security
- We employ local database encryption to protect the internal configuration flags stored on your device.

6. Children's Privacy
- Volume Booster PI does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
