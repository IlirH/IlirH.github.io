Privacy Policy for Exif Remover PI
Last updated: February 12, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Exif Remover PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information. 
By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. General Overview
Exif Remover PI is a privacy-focused utility designed to detect and remove metadata (Exif tags) from your photos.
- We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data, images, or usage logs to external servers.
- The app operates 100% offline.
- Your photos never leave your device.

2. Metadata & Location Data
To fulfill its core functionality, the app must access and read the metadata contained within your selected images, which may include:
- GPS Coordinates (Location data)
- Device Information (Camera make, model, serial number)
- Capture Settings (Date, time, software used)

This data is processed solely in your device's temporary memory (RAM) for the purpose of displaying it to you and creating a sanitized copy of the image. This data is instantly discarded after processing and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

3. Data Security & Encryption
- All image processing is performed locally on your device.
- Internal app preferences (such as "Dark Mode" or "Early User" status) are stored in a local, encrypted database (SQLCipher) to ensure your app settings remain private and secure.

4. File Storage & Permissions
The app strictly adheres to Android's "Scoped Storage" guidelines:
- We only access the specific single images you explicitly select via the system file picker.
- We do not have broad access to your entire gallery.
- "Sanitized" (cleaned) images are saved to a dedicated folder on your device (Pictures/Exif Remover PI). We do not overwrite your original files.

5. Third-Party Services
- This app does not contain third-party advertisements, analytics, or tracking SDKs.
- No data is shared with third parties.

6. Children’s Privacy
Exif Remover PI does not knowingly collect personal data from children. As a utility tool that operates offline and collects no data, it is suitable for general audiences.
