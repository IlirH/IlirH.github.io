Data Sharing

Android Device Manager PI does not share any user data with third parties. The information accessed from the Android system API is used exclusively within the App and is not shared externally.

Data Security

While we do not collect or store any user data, we take reasonable measures to ensure the security of the information accessed through the Android system API. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.

Children's Privacy

Android Device Manager PI is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.
