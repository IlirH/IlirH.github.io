Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 20, 2024

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how CryptoBit ("we", "us", or "our") handles personal information in relation to the app's services. The CryptoBit is designed to provide users with text encryption services using various algorithms such as reverse cipher, shift cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, one-time pad, MD5 hash, SHA-256, SHA-512, and Morse code.

Information We Collect

CryptoBit is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or text input by users, with the exception of data collected by third-party services such as Google AdMob for advertising purposes. All processing of text input is done locally on the user's device.

Data Usage

The only data usage outside of local processing involves the Google AdMob SDK, which may collect information for the purpose of serving targeted advertising within the app. This may include, but is not limited to, device identifiers and interactions with ads.

Data Security

We strive to protect the security of your information. As no sensitive data is collected, stored, or transmitted by us directly, the risk of data breaches is significantly minimized. All encryption operations are performed locally on your device. However, we advise caution when using the clipboard functionality within the app, as copied text could be accessed by other applications.

Children's Privacy

CryptoBit is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
