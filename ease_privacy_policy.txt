Privacy Policy for Ease
Last updated: January 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Ease ("Ease", "we", "us", or "our") handles user information. By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. Data Collection & Usage
Ease is designed to be a private, secure, and offline mindfulness tool.

- Ease provides tools for guided 4-7-8 rhythmic breathing and anxiety relief.
- The app tracks "Mindful Minutes" and session history (date, time, and duration) to help users monitor their progress.
- All session data is stored locally on the device in an encrypted database.
- Ease does not collect, transmit, or store personal data on external servers.

2. Offline Usage
- Ease works fully offline.
- No internet connection is required for core functionality.
- No user data is transmitted over the network.

3. Permissions
Ease requests only the minimum permissions required for core functionality:
- No sensitive permissions are requested.
- The app utilizes the device's vibration motor (Haptics) to provide tactile breathing guidance, but this does not access user data.

4. Data Storage & Encryption
- Ease takes your privacy seriously. All local data, including your breathing session history and preferences, is stored in a secure local database.
- We utilize SQLCipher, an industry-standard extension, to encrypt your data at rest on your device. This means your personal journey remains private and inaccessible to other applications.
- Users may clear app data at any time via the device's system settings.

5. Third-Party Services
- Ease does not use third-party analytics, tracking, profiling, or advertising services.
- No personal data is shared with third parties.

6. Data Security
- All data handled by Ease remains strictly on the user’s device.
- We employ strong encryption standards (AES-256 via SQLCipher) to ensure that your local data is protected against unauthorized access.
- Ease does not transmit user data externally.

7. Children’s Privacy
- Ease does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
- As no personal data is collected or transmitted, the app is suitable for general audiences.

8. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes or to comply with legal requirements. Any updates will be reflected in the app’s store listing.
