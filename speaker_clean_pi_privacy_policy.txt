Privacy Policy for Speaker Clean PI
Last updated: January 27, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Speaker Clean PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles user information.
By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. Data Collection & Usage
Speaker Clean PI is designed to be a secure, private utility for maintaining your device's audio hardware.
- The app functions as a local utility tool.
- We do not collect, transmit, or store personal data, usage logs, or audio recordings on external servers.
- Any app preferences (such as "Dark Mode" or "Early User" status) are stored locally on your device.

2. Hardware Usage (Speakers & Vibration)
To perform its core function (Water Ejection and Speaker Cleaning), the app requires access to specific hardware features:
- Audio Output: The app generates specific high-frequency sine waves. It does NOT use the microphone and does NOT record any audio.
- Vibration (Haptics): The app uses the device's vibration motor to assist in dislodging water.
- Volume Control: The app requests permission to maximize volume temporarily during the cleaning process to ensure effectiveness.

3. Data Storage & Encryption
- We utilize industry-standard encryption to protect local app data.
- The app uses SQLCipher (AES-256 encryption) to secure the local database where your app preferences and status flags are stored.
- This ensures that even your local preference data remains private and inaccessible to other applications or unauthorized access.

4. Offline Usage
- Speaker Clean PI works fully offline.
- No internet connection is required for the core "Cleaning" or "Stereo Test" functionality.
- No user data is transmitted over the network.

5. Permissions
The app requests only the minimum permissions required for functionality:
- MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS: Required to set the volume to 100% during the cleaning cycle.
- VIBRATE: Required to run the vibration engine for water ejection.
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE (if applicable): Used only to ensure the cleaning tone continues uninterrupted if you minimize the app.

6. Third-Party Services
- This version of the app does not use third-party analytics, tracking, profiling, or advertising services.
- No personal data is shared with third parties.

7. Children’s Privacy
- Speaker Clean PI does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
- As a utility tool that collects no personal data, it is suitable for general audiences.

8. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes (e.g., if new features are added).
Any updates will be reflected in the app’s store listing and this document.
