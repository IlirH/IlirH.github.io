Privacy Policy for Headphone Mode Off PI
Last updated: February 17, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Headphone Mode Off PI ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information.
By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.

1. General Overview
Headphone Mode Off PI is a utility designed to fix audio routing issues on your device.
- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
- The app operates 100% offline.
- We do not access your location, contacts, or files.

2. Audio Permissions & Functionality
To function correctly, the app interacts with your device's audio hardware in the following ways:
- Audio Settings: We use the "Modify Audio Settings" permission to force audio output to your built-in speaker or headphones.
- Hardware Detection: The app detects whether a headphone jack or USB audio device is plugged in to display the correct status.

This process happens entirely on your device. We do not record audio, listen to calls, or analyze sound.

3. Local Data & Encryption
The app stores simple preference data (such as your "Dark Mode" setting or "App Status") locally on your device.
- This data is stored in a secure, encrypted database to ensure your preferences remain private.
- This data never leaves your device and cannot be accessed by other apps.

4. Audio Testing
The "Test Audio" feature allows you to play a system notification sound to verify that the speaker fix is working. This happens locally and does not access your personal music library.

5. Third-Party Services
- This app does not contain third-party advertisements or tracking software.
- No user data is shared with any third parties.

6. Children’s Privacy
Since this application does not collect data and operates offline, it is safe for all age groups. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
